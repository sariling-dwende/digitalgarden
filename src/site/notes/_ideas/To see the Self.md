It is a terribly daunting task to see the self because on the onset, it already implies that you must [[effects of removing myself from the ego\|remove yourself from it]]. To be an observer and change perspective at the speed of thought. At some point, I can say that I have achieved this flexibility brought by years of self-experimentation where I subjected myself to various forms of mental isolation. I have fragmented enough parts of me for ease of compartmentalization. Oftentimes conflating one aspect of thought and personality to another, where confusion reigns as the supreme form of self-knowledge.

To see the self in a constant stream of continuous moments is not the goal of why one must see their self. At this moment, it is a part of what it means to be human. That active awareness, the always-on display of one's own perspective of the self, is one of the factors that allow me to designate a person's maturity. It is one thing to be aware but to be aware of the whys and hows of your untrained knee-jerk responses is to map out your being.

To learn how to see the self is a prerequisite and the basic unit for understanding other people. It mirrors the principle of The Golden Rule, whereas in initiating the understanding to one's self leads to the wholehearted understanding of others.
