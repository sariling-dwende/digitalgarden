Often fragile but yearns for stability. I always thought of myself as someone who is still trying to decode the meaning of humanity, its purpose and the justification of its collective existence.

This exploration isn't unchartered. A lot of philosophers have already attempted to give meaning to this (which are ideas that I really haven't fully given enough time to read--nor will I also do in the near future) and I do not aim to add something to the discourse. It is as if I am also trying to just get a grasp of this idea for my own peace of mind. 

Going through [[_ideas/what I learned in therapy\|therapy]] marked a paradigm shift on my mind. I used to believe that I cannot trust other people--that the only one who I can make a pact with, which is a promise that can binds me to death, is my self. There is still a molecule of this idea that I find undeniably true but it intensity in terms of my guiding principles in life has ben reduced only to the fraction of my being. What I mean to say is that I have given up on the idea that I can survive in this world alone without the help of other people.

How we become, is entirely dependent on how we see ourselves and how we perceive the influence of other people to us.
