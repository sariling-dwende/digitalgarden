Happiness as often misunderstood as the goal of life, when in fact it is merely a desire for a positive, comfortable status of one's self. This drive, in this definition makes man's often happiness-seeking self, becomes hedonistic. Pain must be avoided; pleasure, we must seek. In making happiness the ultimate goal of life subjects the self into a life of hedonistic pleasures.

This predicament is not a conscious fault. It is physiological in nature, where in avoiding pain, suffering, and living a life of comfort is the brain's default programming. Pain is undesirable while its importance remains taken for granted.
