# Welcome to apocrypha.

Here you will find my networked thought, where some may be fleeting and permanent. This is a record of my musings about various things from the mundane events of my own life up to the abstraction of thought itself. Somewhere in between those concepts lies everything that this mind is able to think of. I plan for this to be a space for unfinished thoughts and ideas linked together towards a coherent whole.

Origin: [[A Preface to the Apocrypha\|A Preface to the Apocrypha]]

## Navigating the labyrinth
This space contains a web of ideas where reading and writing is meant to be exploratory. There is no specific topic designed where each idea is labelled by an umbrella term, concept, or label. Every idea becomes relational, contextual, and hypertextual. There is no underlying structure to begin with. Since this is a perpetual work in progress, the structure will continuously adapt, based on every idea that has ever been published here. Each page is an idea that is often connected to other ideas that follows the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) method of note-taking. Each idea is an atom of another idea or strings of ideas. 

## The web of ideas
On the upper-left (if you are viewing this on a desktop) or the bottom of the page, you will see how each note is connected to others. Depending on how each of them are related, be it in similarity, origin, or tangent of a thought, a line will always connect one note from another.

Each dot is a representation of a single note and depending on how many simultaneous connections it has with other notes, it grows in size. Hovering on a dot will tell you the title of a note, which may already tell you what it's about or maybe not.

## Points of Origin
As of this moment, I only have 4 points of origin from where we can start. As the number of notes in this space grow, these will potentially expand, condense, or remain the same.

* [[_creative/_creative\|_creative]]: prose, poetry, and other themes of writing
* [[_events/_events\|_events]]: notes that often relate to describing real-world events in my life
* [[_musings/_musings\|_musings]]: notes that are usually longer that may have been triggered by [[_events/_events\|life events]] as what was just mentioned above
* [[_thoughts/_thoughts\|_thoughts]]: notes that are short, often records of tiny bits of [[_events/_events\|life events]] or [[_musings/_musings\|musings]] that occur to me on a daily basis

## A digital space for an evolving self-portrait
I want to craft an image of myself that depends on my thoughts. After experiencing 
[[_events/The point of it all\|creative setbacks due to dishonest writing]], I have begun to understand more of myself and my relationship with language and writing since then. This space will stand as an omnidirectional representation of my own self.
