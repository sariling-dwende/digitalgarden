I'm wondering if there is a force that I must overcome this month. As it has happened, it almost seems like I am having a bigger perspective in terms of making sense of my life situation as an overarching theme with each month that passes. I would like to understand as well what are the experiential implications of having such perspective. At times, it makes me feel more myopic than to insist on living life day after day. Looking at it as a whole chapter, watching it unravel, is a lot more hopeful, but also a bit of a gambler's dilemma. It requires me to plan but also to be flexible when it is necessary. I need to mull this over.
