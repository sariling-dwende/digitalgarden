I've been terribly sick in the past few days. I was unable to log my thoughts during those days because of the fact that temperature reached above 37 degrees Celsius. Any attempt at deep thinking resulted to dizziness and further confusion.

I am still in the process of recovering. The main reason is due to the tremendous heat this summer has been.
