Let's try and set the direction for this month. This will be a month in an attempt to understand Hegel. At least to have a better understanding of his concepts to how I used to before. Since it was revealed to me that Hegel is a "Christian thinker," I thought it is best to continue this path of discovery. My intuition tells me that I must first try to actually have a good grasp on Western Idealism. To be honest, I still don't know what this means but let me add that to the list of I must revisit.

My focus on Christianity last month is something that I have accepted to be one of the becoming constants in my life. I think it will have a permanent foothold in forming my personal beliefs moving forward. In my attempts to grapple with freedom and transcendence, perhaps Hegel is overdue.

So I have been reading Jon Stewart's *Hegel's Interpretation of the Religions of the World.* So far, it has been riveting to a point that I find myself agreeing with the dialectical and historical approach to understanding God through the religions that have emerged. I think this would deeply help me get the answers that I need in the correct context and language.

April will be a tough hill to climb. But I believe that I can use the tools that I have learned in cultivating a habit and mental discipline to climb this mountain of idealism.
