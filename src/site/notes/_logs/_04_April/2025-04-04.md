There was that theme again: flexibility. I had thought about this idea a couple of times now when I used to talk about [[_logs/_01_January/2025-01-27\|consistency]] and [[_logs/_01_January/2025-01-26\|routine]]. Now, I'm seeing it within the definition that I gave for [[_logs/_03_March/2025-03-31\|faith]] (at least in a way that makes sense to me outside the realm of religion and spirituality). A lot of thoughts are swirling in my head regarding this approach to knowing, which is also unknowing in itself. I feel like I surrender myself to something that I already know. It feels like I know that I know but I choose not to realize it in the surface of my consciousness. Psychologically, it already makes its nature known, which is something in between my fears and anxieties. However, I know that being afraid of something is more about the reason behind the fear than the actual object being feared.

I would allow this thought to permeate my reality through the weekend. I think I am in a slow processing mood for a bigger theme for this month.
