I used to hold the belief that most of what we know are self-soothing fabrications of a world that we understand. In this way, we can learn how to live with nothingness by creating more artificiality in the world. In a sense, I think that [[_musings/Liminal Spaces#^ea4dd5\|Truth]] is [[_musings/Liminal Spaces#^c361ed\|Nothingness]] itself. This is more of an interpretation of Heidegger's *das nichts.* I am not yet sure if this some type of epistemological pessimism or if this idea is still something that I have been holding on to. To respond to that previous sentence, perhaps, partly, I still believe that this nothingness is what still governs us, which also allows us to pursue a symbolic ideal that we use to substitute to this void.

Let me sit through this quite another recognition of the void within me.
