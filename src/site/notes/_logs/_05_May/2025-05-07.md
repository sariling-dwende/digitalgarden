I am reflecting on what I have been writing about. For what they are worth, I still believe that I am working towards a personal philosophy that is purely in an intellectual activity. This reflection is spurred by this deep-seated uneasiness that is coming from my core. I feel that I have gone through empirical observation (and phenomenologically to some extent) of human behaviors and consequences of series of events and I have intellectualized them enough to form a system of belief that is aligned with the Stoics, Kantian Deontology, and Hegel's Spirit. With all these knowledge, I feel like the test of spirit is already happening in a sense that whatever I know about love, freedom, faith, and duty is being tested by standing by my principles. This is a huge task in itself because moments of failure carry more weight compared to the intellectual activity of arguing what does justice mean? Failing to perform my duty would not result to just a mental break where I can try again without external consequences. It is time when I practice this framework into the real world and act upon on what I believe to be true.
