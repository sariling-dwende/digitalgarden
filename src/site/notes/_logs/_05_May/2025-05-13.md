I have been practicing recording my voice. I've taken some time to read off Kierkegaard's *Either/Or* earlier and trying to familiarize myself due to the uncanniness that I've always felt in hearing my voice in recorded zoom meetings and older recordings of myself whenever I hear my speaking voice.

I'm starting to get the hang of it and identify the voice that I hear in playback as part of me. I'm working on different types of delivery that I can experiment with. I'm finding that I can use this opportunity to fuse my writing with my own voice. It has been a long time coming but now that I've bought a decent mic, I think I have a lot of space to work with. This is a new ground for me but I think this is a place where I can explore other ways of expressing myself beyond writing.
