It's one of those days. It was quiet but I've been running on fumes. Perhaps this is my true day of rest that it feels like parts of the world that I have picked up myself detached themselves away from me. It seems like a silent catharsis that's out of my system. There is no sigh of relief, but a nondescript flowing of energy from my body to the world. I feel tired, spiritually but my body just keeps on doing what it's been doing in an automatic fashion. My mind is out there. I am here. I don't feel complete. I think it's unfair timing that work resumes tomorrow and I wasn't given a chance to properly rest my head.
