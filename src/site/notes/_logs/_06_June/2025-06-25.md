I have a lot of big ideas in my head right now. It's been becoming harder to focus even if I've been at my most focused in the past few years. I can feel my subconscious becoming stacked with chunks of information faster than it an process these ideas. I know that I am stocking up on information that I believe will be processed in the background so I can make more connections better. There is a bigger picture in this and I don't think I should move forward in this process of creation before I can hint a glimpse of it. I know I don't know it yet but I know I will know in the future. I'm making it a case of eventual knowing and I am taking every single small step and let everything stick to my experience. Every single idea, every thought discarded, every texture of these thoughts, the roughness of every conjecture, and every denial of my own biases. I'm seeing good things coming out from me in the near future. Days begin to pass by quickly in a sense that it still feels like I'm writing daily logs, only to realize that I have been almost consistently logging one day after the other. Anyway, I am learning a lot of things and seeing connections in things I didn't knew were, because I only assumed. Now, my intuitions are being proven true and I am wallowing in this newfound sense of discovery.
