I think I am pouring a lot of energy in my current project and I found a way to maximize my input. I'm getting a lot of information and I'm back on my old habit of learning. I'm seeing a lot of connection in various things and it seems that my years of background working as a knowledge worker is paying off.

It feels like discovering a new metaphor, linking one idea to another to form a new thought, a new approach at looking at the world. I felt that my perspective is the message that I have been trying to communicate. I know I see the world differently but I may have lacked the necessary confidence to articulate it. Creating my own metaphor, my own way of looking at the world, sounds a lot like a form of sublation, under a Hegelian dialectic, I understand that I found my way back to the self that I love: that creative spirit that has been waiting to emerge now becoming more and more manifest.
