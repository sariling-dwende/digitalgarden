One of my lowest post-work energy happened today. I have been waving my thoughts around faith and the theology of Christianity in the previous days and that practice was mostly what has been taking up my 5-9. I won't be able to do that today because I'm already in bed before 8pm and I am already preparing to sleep.

But today was also a day of noise. The house next door has been building a gate so the sound of grinding metal was also nonstop. I had to stay downstairs for the rest of the day to work because the heat is turning up as March begins its 180-flip of temperature. Here in our region, it's not as bad as it is in the Metro where universities and schools had to suspend classes for the day. I still have cool mornings and the breeze has been helping to minimize the heat wave.

Then I guess, I'll take my mind to rest. I've had enough of online cringe content today just to push myself to the direction of resting.
