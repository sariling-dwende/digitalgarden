Yesterday's single-line log was in very obvious ways the total opposite of what I have been trying to achieve. Yet, at the same time, I can feel that it's one of those manifestations of being physically alone. My mind starts to wander off and it's been one of the rest days that fully dictates that rest is the priority. I am diving into this ocean of solitude and at the same time, I am one with the world. I do not know how it feels like floating inside a sensory deprivation tank but this must be how the mind can comprehend how moments of lucidity becomes a surrender to the waves of the world.
