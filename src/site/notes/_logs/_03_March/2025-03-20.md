I want to write another poem. I think I am ready once again to weave words in an attempt to reach sublimity.

And I think I will have a better grasp at it. I used to throw words into the page into a full blind faith. I only hoped that they would eventually make sense. Jargons become meaningful if you put enough context around it to frame a meaning. These words are already charged so they bleed meaning all over the page wherever you put them. The density of the page causes the page to overflow with meaning because it cannot contain all the associations it has and eventually these meanings blend into other versions of truth. It is the perfect recipe for ambiguity and meaningfulness.

But now I think I know what I want to say and I want to give it another try. I want to surprise myself. But above everything, I want to rebuild my relationship with language itself.
