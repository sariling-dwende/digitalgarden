Reading a fragment from Derrida's "Force and Signification" this morning, and it strikes a familiar, unsettling chord. "Speaking frightens me because, by never saying enough, I also say too much." This cuts close. It resonates deeply with that persistent anxiety around communication, the one [[_musings/What I Learned in Therapy\|therapy began to uncover]] – the feeling that the gap between internal complexity and external articulation is fundamentally unbridgeable, yet the attempt itself risks unintended exposure, a misrepresentation that feels like its own kind of violation. Never saying enough: the inadequacy, the inevitable simplification, the failure to capture the nuance. Saying too much: the excess meaning spilling over, the interpretations beyond control, the vulnerability of being misunderstood, perhaps more profoundly than if one had remained silent.

It's a fear I recognize in my own past reliance on [[_events/Making sense of making sense\|obscurity]], a defense mechanism against this very paradox. If clarity is impossible and always risks saying too much in the wrong way, then perhaps deliberate obfuscation felt safer, paradoxically allowing a different kind of communication, one reliant on resonance rather than precision. But that path proved hollow, a denial of responsibility.

And then Derrida tightens the screw: "...if the necessity of becoming breath or speech restricts meaning—and our responsibility for it—writing restricts and constrains speech further still." This throws the current project, these [[_logs/_logs\|daily logs]], into a stark, perhaps uncomfortable light. This act of writing, this daily attempt to pin down thoughts, to engage in [[_musings/The only way to live is to dig deeper\|self-examination]] and build a [[_musings/In Praise of Deliberate Decisions\|deliberate self]] through inscription – is it merely compounding the restriction? If speech already filters and potentially distorts the flow of thought or being (the *ruah* he mentions, that breath/spirit), does writing – this fixing onto the page, this creation of a "second body" as Seymour put it [[_events/The point of it all\|The point of it all]] – impose an even harsher constraint?

Does this daily practice, intended to foster clarity and self-knowledge, actually lead further away from the living thought by subjecting it to the rigid structure of written language? Am I creating a more refined understanding, or just a more meticulously constructed cage? The responsibility weighs differently here. In speech, the context, the immediacy, allows for some fluidity. Writing feels more permanent, more starkly presented, demanding a different kind of accountability for its inevitable failures to capture the whole.

It circles back to that tension between the desire for authentic expression and the inherent limitations of the medium. [[_musings/A Journey into the Self\|The journey]] isn't just about discovering what's inside, but grappling with the flawed tools we have to articulate it, to ourselves and potentially to others. This fear Derrida voices isn't a reason to stop, perhaps, but a necessary awareness to carry – the knowledge that every act of signification, speaking or writing, is fraught with this anguish, this responsibility for meaning that can never be fully controlled or contained. Another layer of complexity to navigate, another reason why the path requires constant vigilance against [[_thoughts/Hell is ourselves\|self-delusion]]. The work continues, but with a renewed sense of its inherent precarity.
