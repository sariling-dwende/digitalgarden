Today was cold. I woke up with a kind of relaxed resignation that the the chill in the air is so familiar that I knew everything that will happen is going to be okay. It is a kind of half self-predetermination and half-self delusion because of a familiar feeling of how the coldness touched my skin. This cold was a memory revisiting me in my present. This cold is similar to how I chased after warmth. This cold led me to a warmth that told me that everything is going to be okay. What happens after that is a story how I learned how to trust the cold.

I let the breeze in. The world becomes bittersweet, unserious, but I am happy that everything becomes real when I open the door.
