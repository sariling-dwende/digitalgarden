I'm feeling more of my creative self lately. There is a sense of feeling imprisoned in my own body, whose agency is being threatened by my own sense of duty to my day job. There is uneasiness. There is a feeling of suffocation. It feels something ancient but familiar enough to distract me from my present. It is a tug-of-war of stability that yanks me from standing upright.

My mind is off today.
