Somehow, my body chose to woke up today with all the wirings in my brain disorganized. It felt like I was lagging behind a couple of minutes before the world starts to make sense, or at least make sense around the time when it should have already made sense. I was only trying to catch up with what is happening around me today. I am totally disoriented.

Woke up at around 9am and went back to sleep at 11am, and finally waking up at 2pm. The intermittent sleeping may have fucked with my brain and body clock but I still haven't feel entirely rested. This is just a note to check on my current status today.
