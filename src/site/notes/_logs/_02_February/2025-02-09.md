Birthday plans went well. Precisely because there was no plan at all. Watched Scorsese's *The Departed (2006)* and *A Real Pain (2024)*. The only notable thing today was a lot of people have greeted me, at least more than my average of 5 people. Most likely because it was due to Fatima's IG story but still 10 people is a lot in my early adult phase.

I guess there is nothing else to talk about today since most of the time was spent about reflecting on our chosen service topic which is forgiveness. We had more than an hour's worth of discussion about it, which tangentially touched on the social issues, patriarchy, incels, and friendship (at least those things that I can remember but there were a lot). I'm only grateful that today actually felt like a day of rest.

I never really paid much attention during my birthdays. Celebrating isn't something I'm fond of. I decide to not pay too much importance in my own day. The only requirement is that whatever happens during that day is something that is fully within my conscious choice. I chose the day to happen the way it can happen. That is enough. I do not require for people to give me gifts or recognize the day when I started to exist. I just let the day pass without much fanfare. I don't know if it defeats the purpose of being so but I think this is an internal rule for me to keep myself humble.
