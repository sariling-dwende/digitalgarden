I am thinking that there is a huge possibility how I write my logs. If there are specific topics that I should not talk about or a requirement of a specific line of thinking that should I enforce in order to make it more organized, at least in its tone or messaging. This idea only came about because I was considering if there is value in adding another layer of consistency that will allow me to passively direct my mind into writing short bursts of thought even if the state of my body and mind are both in an undesired state.

Such as today. I did not get a good sleep in the [[_logs/_02_February/2025-02-01\|past weekend]]. Another work week has started and it feels like my body is once again forced to be functional while some of the wires in my brain are still rewiring themselves into their correct places. I still feel like I am chasing the rest from last weekend, which means that the thoughts in my head are still foggy at best.

So I thought if I should require myself to exert more effort in the face of unreadiness. Until now, it's still a thought that holds no truth value. I would still let this one sit for a while. But I just feel emotionally tired today.
