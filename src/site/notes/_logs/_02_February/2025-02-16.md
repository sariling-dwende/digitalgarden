The first slip happened yesterday. I was so out of it even if half of my day was spent lying down and watching movies and shows on the TV. The other half was desperately trying to bring my phone back to life when an update led to a fastboot bootloop. That was at least 7 hours of continuous work trying to figure out how to make my phone work again.

It was midnight when I made it work and I was all so out of my head to write. I had actually thought of putting some words in but deliberately decided to skip the day and rest because today was the day we are going to attend to a Christian church service. This is my first time attending that isn't livestreamed via YouTube. This is also my first time leaving the house this month and since [[2025-01-19]|January 19th].

Today was a day of another confirmation of my idea about love. I will not elaborate tonight.
