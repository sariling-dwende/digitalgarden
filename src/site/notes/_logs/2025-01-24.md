Today is a still wave. A consumption habit resigned from the immediacy of thought. It is a feeling of brain muscles relaxing, of a heart deliberately beating slow, towards breath from the firing of neurons, where a habit is slowly learning how to capture intervals and have the body adopt this routine. 

It still took some brainpower to rest but we are loosely getting the hang of it. All this mental fatigue may have been caused by terrible work events this week but it's not the end of everything. Perspective and degrees of perspective. At the same time, learning to capture the rhythm of shifting between degrees of perspective. All I am doing is documenting my own state, its fluctuations, and current findings. What is working and what requires more data from my experience of now. 

It is quiet inside the mind but some ideas are marinating under the heat of a creative vision. Since this space is still meant to be public, I must learn how to hide it from my own perspective of the public eye until the idea manifests itself in a form that I want it. We will wait until it takes the form of my own vision.

For now, an interlude.
