Starting July feels like stepping on a ledge of a cliff. One that has been feeling the most secure after a lot of ledges, climbing up this steep cliff. It feels like a save point in a video game. It feels as if I can sit on this ledge and rest my back, my entire weight against this rough rock solid earth that I had been trying to climb. It brings a feeling of safety with an afterthought of the long journey ahead.

At the same time it brings a sense of uneasiness. Knowing full well that staying on this ledge is impossible and that this feeling of security is only temporary. Depending on this ledge to hold my weight is a delusion that would compromise my entire progress. I still need to move. I still need to think.

But for a while, let me rest for a bit here. I am becoming more aware of my own breathing. I am alive. I am creating something.
