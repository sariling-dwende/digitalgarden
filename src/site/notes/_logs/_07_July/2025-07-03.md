Precisely today is the most stable I have ever felt in the past few months. No tradeoffs in negative and positive emotions. I have done everything I needed to do today both in the house and at work. I cooked a good meal. I was flawless in my presentation of my solution to a work problem earlier. I am full and ate a lot with gusto, even more so than when I was eating meals from the meal plan subscription. Tomorrow, a new supermarket will open just outside our subdivision and I'm looking forward to do the grocery.

The status of my brain post-shift feels calmer than sleep. I have yet to attribute this mental stability to those sleep gummies I had been taking since last week but I am worrying less about the future, which is the by-product of actually doing things or solving problems immediately when they arise. No piling up of works. I am not dealing with any backlogs. The only issue right now with my own state is my health. I have been feeling a bit unwell. I'm dealing with colds and sore throat for two days now. I just need to recover fully in order to attain this sense of bliss, hoping that this mental stability becomes more permanent, at least for as long as it can.
