The body opens like a house with too many doors. Each morning I count the ways light enters—through eyelids, through pores, through the spaces between fingers when I hold my hand against the sun. The windows are clean but something is always missing. I check the mirrors: my reflection shifts between prisoner and guard.

What does it mean to live inside bone and tissue? Yesterday, I watched a woman teach her child to dance. In the studio across the street, their twin images glided across the glass. The child's arms refused to follow, each gesture a rebellion against grace. The mother adjusted limbs like furniture, arranged the body into a room she recognized. _This is how you move_, she seemed to say. _This is how you learn to stay_.

Some days the body feels like a subway station at rush hour. Crowded with desires that push against turnstiles, that race down escalators, that squeeze through closing doors. I stand in the midst of this traffic, collecting tickets to places I cannot name. The trains arrive with their cargo of breath and sweat. They leave with pieces of me I didn't know I could spare.

At the hospital, my aunt points to the x-ray of her chest: _See how the bones make a cage?_ The ribs curve like fingers holding something precious. The heart beats against its prison bars, and yet—isn't this what keeps it from spilling into the world? Isn't this what gives it shape, what allows it to pump life into the darkest corners of our architecture?

I think of the dancers in the studio, how containment creates its own kind of freedom. How the child's body, bound by position and form, finally found flight in the discipline of movement. How my aunt's heart, enclosed in its calcium fortress, performs its ancient rhythm without fear of falling.

The body opens like a story with too many endings. Each night I count the ways darkness enters—through memory, through pain, through the spaces between sleeping and waking where I sometimes forget which doors are mine. I check the mirrors: my reflection blurs between inhabitant and home. What does it mean to be both lock and key? To guard the very thing that holds you? Tomorrow, I will wake to find new rooms in old joints, windows where walls used to be. The light will enter, as it always does, and I will continue this endless work of living in translation.
