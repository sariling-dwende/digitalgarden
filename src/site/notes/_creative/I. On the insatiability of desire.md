![On the insatiability of desire](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b9ad6e-b649-4bd5-80e7-a97892291c81_5000x8000.jpeg "On the insatiability of desire")

The Other is always the amorphous form of my desire. It takes the density of a solid sphere and the fragility of a bubble. It is my anchor that floats above me, eclipsing the grammar of my own thoughts and emotions. I am here, chained to that which I lack. A lack that is only created by my desire to desire. The more I desire, the more this otherness grows in size. It becomes the quantifiable element of my ambitions, my dreams--my lack. It is all that is not me and all I want to be. It is the absoluteness of the future that will never arrive. It is the second coming of Christ. It is perfection in its purest form. It is a promise that I recite in prayer. It is the enunciation of my existence: the disembodied voice, and its utterance is what incarnates my body. I am here (and I am there), incomplete and complemented by this void that incompletes me. I am one with the Other.
