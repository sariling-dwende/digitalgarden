Exegesis: then, we forgave God for creating the universe. It was “inevitability” in its purest form.

Some yesterdays bear the weight of a thousand tomorrows. A lot of “there” almost always feels like a hundred “here.” If I divide now into sections as thin and as many as the strands of my hair, will I be able to tug them to ease my frustration? And if I’m unable to answer your question about where I am, can I reply, “maybe?” So if I have broken down my existence into tiny moments of possibilities, would I finally arrive between appearance and disappearance?
