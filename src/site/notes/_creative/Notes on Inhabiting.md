# I.

The body refuses to be metaphor. Even as I write this, a tooth aches in protest, marking territory. Even as I try to make sense of living inside skin, my left knee catalogs its scars — childhood, bicycle, sidewalk, grief.

What is consciousness but the study of doors? At the anatomy lab, students peel back layers of cadaver like wallpaper. They name each revelation: fascia, muscle, nerve. The body teaching itself to be a house after death. I press my palm against my sternum and count backward from ten. Someone must be home.

Between breaths, the fragment of a memory: Age seven, stuck in an elevator between floors. The walls so close I could taste their metal. My mother’s voice floating down the shaft: _Stay still, stay calm_. But the body had other plans — sweat, tremors, heart like a fist against ribs. Now, twenty years later, in a crowded train, that same taste returns. The body remembers what the mind tries to forget.

# II.

Morning ritual: I stand before the mirror and practice inhabiting. One arm, then the other. The precise angle of clavicle. The deep valley behind each knee. Some days it works — consciousness settling into joints like water finding its level. Other days, I am a ghost rattling through rooms, unable to grasp the doorknobs of my own hands.

At the dance studio across the street, a woman teaches her daughter positions: _plié, relevé, port de bras_. The child’s limbs resist their French names. Her body speaks a different language — all playground verbs and sidewalk nouns. Through the window, I watch this negotiation between flesh and form. How many languages must we learn to live inside ourselves?

The x-ray on my doctor’s wall: constellation of bones, white architecture against black space. She points to a shadow near the spine. _Here_, she says, _where freedom meets its limit_. But what is freedom if not the pressure against boundaries? Ask any blood cell pushing through capillaries. Ask any synapse firing across the dark.

The body insists on its own reality. Tonight, eating soup alone in my kitchen, I burn my tongue. The pain blooms precise and wordless. No metaphor can contain it. No poetry can make it mean more than this: nerve endings sending urgent telegrams to the brain. The body, for once, speaking only as itself.

# III.

Between sleeping and waking, I practice the phenomenology of fingers, toes, the soft hollow behind each ear. The body opens into rooms I never knew existed. Sometimes I hear music from behind a door — bone against bone, blood rushing its ancient corridors. Sometimes I find windows where walls used to be. Through them, I watch consciousness perform its daily migration: from skin to soul and back again, never quite learning where one ends and the other begins.

The body refuses to be metaphor, and yet — here I am, trying to translate its grammar into words. Even now, it protests: stomach growling, muscles twitching, eyes growing heavy with sleep. Even now, it reminds me: every sentence ends in flesh.
