Welcome to apocrypha.

Here you will find my networked thought, where some may be fleeting and permanent. This is a record of my musings about various things from the mundane events of my own life up to the abstraction of thought itself. Somewhere in between those concepts lies everything that this mind is able to think of. I plan for this to be a space for unfinished thoughts and ideas linked together towards a coherent whole.
