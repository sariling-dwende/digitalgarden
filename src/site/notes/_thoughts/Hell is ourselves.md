I am confronted by the idea that the the eventual effects of artificial intelligence may result to the peak solipsism that humanity will ever experience. This solipsism feels like a looming desire above everyone's head that stems from the fueled desire for self-gratification brought by social media. The [[_thoughts/Algorithmic-driven Thinking\|algorithm]] confirms only the values of the self, an interconnecting web of mirrors that traps the ego at its center. A web of self-delusions that cannot be penetrated by any foreign consciousness.

We will become men living in our own islands, resulting in an accidental isolation apart from everyone else: pure individualism without the external avenue for criticism and regulation. The self becomes God.
