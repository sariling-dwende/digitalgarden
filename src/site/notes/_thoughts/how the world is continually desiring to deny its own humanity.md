Lately, I am becoming more compelled to align myself to my conceptual roots. With the current developments around technology, culture, and society at large (suffice it to say that I do not specifically mean "progress" in any sense here), I am becoming more and more inclined to think that it is time for me to stop riding the waves. I think this will be my stop. The revolting spirit of counterculture in me is starting its own movement against the zeitgeist. Every single day, the world is solidifying towards an undoable forces of the pursuit of creating the artificial general intelligence, or at least what a lot of people in tech are telling themselves. But I can't help but to put extreme caution in how I will want to proceed with my life, with my current career in corporate, which has been my financial safe haven for some years now. The future imposes a type of risk that I might not be able to accept, which is a type of self-dehumanization without our consent.

Of course, to address the elephant in the room, there is the looming accusation of becoming a luddite. Is this a misinformed dismissal of the progress that we have in technology? The rapid development in quantum research, this seemingly second wave of 19th century industrial revolution is exponentially reaching the levels of eventually putting every single person out of a job. Not to say that being employed or having a career is the pinnacle of what defines us as human but it is the closest and most accessible remnants of our closeness to labor. Even as the unending redefinition of labor by the capitalist pursuit of money has actually already removed the value of labor from our jobs, it is the closest that we have in trying to actualize our sense of becoming human.

Our sense of purpose have already become muddled by this condition and now that it is becoming an inevitability to remove it from our daily lives, the question for the human search of purpose will also become more incredibly difficult. In this age when young people are deciding to be a walking brand ad, man's sense of self is also being stripped away as the consequence of the capitalist society. As we arrive into the automation of the human sensibility, I feel more confident that this stance is beyond just being a luddite. I have tried these tools and to such an extent that the average person may have gone. I am forced in to a working environment when using AI tools has become second-nature. It doesn't take a year before someone realizes that it will cause more net harm than good.

This infographic that shows the changing use-case of AI in our daily lives has become viral in different social media platforms. It is not surprising to see that the top use-case for 2025 is an actual human interaction being replaced by the machine. And in the way things are going right now, it seems that it is very human to stop desiring being human.

What I mean by this is actually processing your own emotions, introspecting about your desires, the 'whys' of life, and particularly, your own life--these cognitive tasks are being offloaded to the machine, which is a self-affirming entity at this point. There were reports from users that GPT-4o has become way "too agreeable," which since then OpenAI claimed to have recalled and disabled the model's [sycophancy tendency](https://hbr.org/2025/04/how-people-are-really-using-gen-ai-in-2025). Not only this but Gemini Stream, Gemini's voice feature has the "Affective Dialogue" feature that lets the model adapt its tone based on your conversation. The emotional aspect of this tech is being tested to us and we are the [[_musings/Technology and its Discontents#^9b5e80\|unaware QA testers]] of these releases.

What I am only getting at here is that perhaps this is the best time, and maybe the only time to jump off this ship because it is very likely that corporate will eat these developments. It only loves productivity and everything that would make it run faster and more efficient. With this, it is very likely that Executive Assistants are soon to be replaced by AI agents. We are running out of things to do that may make our lives feel more meaningful.

We are being handed a world that we never asked and we are opening our mouths wide without knowing what it is so we'll most likely choke on it.
