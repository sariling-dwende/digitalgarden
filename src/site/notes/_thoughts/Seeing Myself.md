I have been consuming a lot of media recently. From books to videos, games and music. I also just went through a 10-day quarantine after catching Covid. The details are completely unrelated.

What has been happening is that, throughout that quarantine period, I was once again in that flow of dissociation. I played video games hours on end. For hours, I binged and finished a TV series while recovering. My mind was elsewhere during those times and it was at that moment--when I was washing the dishes that stuck to me.
